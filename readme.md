# Portfolio Website

This is a dark-light contrast website for my portfolio. It is related to being a web developer, but can be edited to be for any type of portfolio. It includes a bit of custom JavaScript for the typewriter effect and uses a script called "Lightbox" for the project modals.

- Background image overlays
- Typewriter effect in header

## Usage

This website is built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). It uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons.

In order to customize this website, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then, clone this repository and run:

This will install Bootstrap, Sass and Font Awesome. To build your CSS files from Sass, run:
